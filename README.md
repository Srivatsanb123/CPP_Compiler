**Note:**
This app uses subprocess module for running the C++ codes. I written the python code for Windows operating system.

If you want to use it in any other operating system you can do it by changing the extention of the object file on line no. 77 in app.py.

For e.g: 
If you are using a ubuntu then you must change the extension from '.exe' to '.o'.
